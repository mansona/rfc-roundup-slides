  This is one of my favourite "meta" RFCs that is trying to improve the community as a whole. Without intending to be overly reductive on what it's trying to do, this RFC is essentially trying to be an always available resource that provides the sorts of guidance that anyone who came to last month's contributors workshop would have gotten. This is essentially democratizing that same information and putting it in a discoverable place for everyone to get to.

  One of the reasons I am particularly fond of this RFC is because Jessica has done a fantastic job of caputring the disparity between how Ember as a community operates, and how we communicate that on the website. If you ask almost anyone in the community for a bit of advice on how to start contributing they will likely bend over backwards to help you get started and even potentially mentor you through some of the obsticals that might be holding you back. This is all well and good if you are already "in" the ember community, and a member of the community Discord but as we saw last month in the contributors workshop there were a few people dedicated enough to come to a workshop about contributing but weren't already on the discord in the "in crowd".

  This RFC intends to capture the overview needed to start contributing to Ember and make it front and centre for everyone to be able to use!

  I also find this RFC interesting for what it leaves out...
