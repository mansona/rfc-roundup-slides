notes: |
  This RFC was purposely only considering what kind of content should go on the Contribution Guide and not "where should it live" or "what should it look like"! I love this because it explicitly allowed conversation to be focued and stopped some of the major bikeshedding styles of conversation from holding up the progression of the RFC

  Ok so that's enough for the non code related RFCs, I thought I would throw in at least one non "community" related RFC

  - (like guides.emberjs.com)
- What would the design for the new website look like?
- Should we include info on other types of contribution
  - blogs
  - meetup organization
