  Hey everyone, You call know me here. And I assume you all know that I work for Simplabs now?
  They are a great company that support a lot of work on Ember and you should talk to me later if you have any questions

  I'm going to have a slight change of pace from what we've been discussing already. I'm going to talk about some less technial RFCs
