  I'm going to go into each of these in more detail one by one

  what does it mean by "make our website match reality"? we have been making steady improvements to Ember and the programming model over the last 7 years, sometimes the pace is pretty fast and other times it's just a slow and steady progression. The issue that we have is that the website hasn't changed very much in the last 4 years. How many times have you had the conversation with people about "how awesome Ember is" and it just fall on deaf ears? If you do a quick audit of the website it currently does very little to "sell" what is good about Ember right now

  Another thing that we want to make absolutely sure is on point with this redesign, we want it to be completely accessible. And it's just fitting to talk about this on **Global Accessibility Awareness Day**! You could say that we have dropped the ball on this one for the current website - I would say that it's currently "not so bad" but it can definitely be improved. Personally I think the issue is that the current site wasn't built with an Accessibility-First mindset, and also the technology it was built with (and legacy code) made it next to impossible to make significant changes without breaking everything.

  This is where the last point comes in, and how I've been involved in this process. I don't give people a hard time for not making things accessible, I would much prefer to help them in any way that I can and give them the tools that they need so that making it accessible is **easier** than the alternative. Emberifying the Website and making a start on removing some of the legacy code will open up making it easier for contributors to build things that are accessible by default. I have also had the absolute pleasure to work with Mel Sumner who has essentially been mentoring me on all things Accessiblity and you know what? it's not nearly as difficult as it seems from the outside when you're starting up.

  It's also interesting to note that this RFC doesn't go into much detail about the process that this change would be made. We have opted for creating an Ember Design System that will allow us to finally use the Ember Styleguide to get a consistent design language over all the different Ember websites!
