  Starting with the Ember Website Redsign RFC. This is something that I've been somewhat involved in and it's quite near to my heart.

  How many people have seen this RFC?

  The first thing that I would like to point out here is that this is a great example of the point of the RFC process and how it's not just limited to technical changes in EmberJS. This is something that will quite literally change the face of Ember and it is something that is super important a) to get right and b) for everyone in the community to be able to contribute to the process.

  So what's the goal of this RFC?
